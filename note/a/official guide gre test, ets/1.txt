some people think ignore negative actions can be best way to teach
should try to encourage positive actions that is beneficial to 
be repeated
human nature that we want to be accepted and achieve on some level
when people in authority give feedback that we done sth well, drive 
to repeat that action is bound to be strong
statement pay dividends in situations where teacher want student
to repeat certain actions. if educator try to teach classroom etiquette,
appropriate to openly praise a student who raise their hands before speaking
in a class, this sets up a good standard and shapes positive behavior, 
by ignoring the student who interject in class without approval from teacher  
i think one should both praise positive actions and inform negative ones
also must differentiate between big and small:
1. small include talking to another classmate
in the class only temporarily, maybe the student just want some attention
best way probably is ignore
2. big include improper administering or tampering with dangerous chemicals
in science experiment, bully, hit another student
should not be ignored, otherwise bigger problem can arise
author's all-emcompassing statement leaves too much room for negative possibilities
better way to phrase statement, "best way to teach is praise positive actions
and ignore negative actions that are not debilitate classroom efficiency or 
an individual's safety"

need additional evidence
argument can end up a lot weaker than it seems
or might be quite valid
1. whether island changed over 20 years since dr.field visited the island
ex: if had evidence that western intervention at island, 
introduced more western family structure, weaken dr.karp's argument
since dr.field's original study would be accurate and correct
serious weaken dr.karp's conclusion that dr.field's method is invalid and ineffective
2. exact location that interview took place. dr.karp interviewed "children
living in group of islands that includes tertia". they might not interview
a tertian child. could be case that children living in islands near tertia
are raised communally and children in tertia are raised by their biological parents
3. what did they ask and what did children say about their parents
they might say they missed their parents or how their parents left
them in a communal environment
merely talking about their parents does not meant 
they are raised by their biological parents
4. to evaluate the grandiose claim that interview centered method is 
more valid than observation centered approach, need to look at more
examples of interview centered and observation centered studies
and different study designs
perhaps dr.field did not conduct an effective observation centered approach
but other observation centered approaches could be effective
