sample issue task:
as people rely more and more on technology to solve problems,
the ability of humans to think for themselves will 
surely deteriorate

agree
- reliance on tech leads to dependency; rely on problem solving
tech to such a degree that when they fail, we are in worse
shape than if we didn't have them in the first place 
- everyday tech such as calculators and cash registers 
have decreased our ability to perform simple calculations,
a "use it or lose it" approach to thinking ability

disagree
- developing, implementing, and using tech require problem solving
- tech free us from mundane problem solving (calculations) 
and allow us to engage in more complex thinking
- tech is dependent on human ability to think and make choices

middle ground
- enable complex problem solving to thrive while diminish data maintenance
- value or detriment of relying on tech is determined by the individual (or society) using it
or that only those who develop tech (i.e., technical specialists) are maintaining their problem solving skills,
while the rest are losing them

sample response
- common occurrence inconceivable before

48
argument task
- evidence, support, proof
  needed evidence to evaluate (strengthen or weaken) the argument
- stated, claimed, concluded
  alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation
- assumed or supposed without justification or proof
  implications for the argument if assumptions prove unwarranted (not justified or authorized)
- not stated, but necessarily follows from stated
