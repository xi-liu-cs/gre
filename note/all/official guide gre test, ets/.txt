sample issue task:
as people rely more and more on technology to solve problems,
the ability of humans to think for themselves will 
surely deteriorate

agree
- reliance on tech leads to dependency; rely on problem solving
tech to such a degree that when they fail, we are in worse
shape than if we didn't have them in the first place 
- everyday tech such as calculators and cash registers 
have decreased our ability to perform simple calculations,
a "use it or lose it" approach to thinking ability

disagree
- developing, implementing, and using tech require problem solving
- tech free us from mundane problem solving (calculations) 
and allow us to engage in more complex thinking
- tech is dependent on human ability to think and make choices

middle ground
- enable complex problem solving to thrive while diminish data maintenance
- value or detriment of relying on tech is determined by the individual (or society) using it
or that only those who develop tech (i.e., technical specialists) are maintaining their problem solving skills,
while the rest are losing them

sample response
- common occurrence inconceivable before

48
argument task
- evidence, support, proof
  needed evidence to evaluate (strengthen or weaken) the argument
- stated, claimed, concluded
  alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation
- assumed or supposed without justification or proof
  implications for the argument if assumptions prove unwarranted (not justified or authorized)
- not stated, but necessarily follows from stated
  
54
sample arg task
water sports favorite activity
complaints about quality, smell of river
devote more money to riverside recreational facilities

55, 56
- assumption that people who rank water sports "among their favorite recreational activities"
are actually likely to participate in them (possible just like to watch them)
- assumption that what residents say in surveys can be taken at face value (面值, superficial appearance)
- assumption that residents want to do water sports in river (possible that water sports 
are regarded as pursuits for vacations & weekends away from city)
- assumption that park department devoting little of its budget to maintaining recreational 
facilities means facilities are inadequately maintained
- assumption that riverside recreational facilities are facilities designed for people
who participate in water sports and not some other recreational pursuit
- assumption that dirtiness of river is cause of being little used, cleaning river
sufficient to increase recreational use of river
- assumption that complaints about river are numerous and significant
- assumption that state's cleanup occur soon enough to require adjustments
to this year's budget
if assumption prove unwarranted, implications are:
logic of argument falls apart/invalid/unsound
state/city spending their funds unnecessarily

author's arg does not make cogent (说服力, clear, logical, convincing) case for increased resources
easy to understand why cleaner river, but arg is rife (widespread) with holes and assumptions, not strong enough to lead to increased funding

love of water sports. scope and validity not clear. survey could have asked residents if they prefer
using river for water sports or would like to see a hydroelectric (水力发电, generation of electricity using flowing water to drive a turbine 涡轮 that powers a generator) dam built, which may have swayed residents toward river sports. unless fully representative, valid, and reliable, it cannot be used to effectively back author's arg

concrete connection between resident's lack of river use and river's 
current state is not effectively made
though have been complaints, do not know if numerous complaints from
a wide range of people, or one or two individuals who made numerous complaints
tenous (纤细, very weak or slight) connection between complaints and limited use
to strengthen arg, implement a normed survey

author suggests river clean up result in increased water usage
true only if river's water quality and smell result from problems which can be cleaned
if decreased water quality and aroma caused by pollution by factories, conceivably could be remedied
but if quality and aroma results from natural mineral deposits in the water
or surrounding rock, may smell of sulphur 硫磺 due to geography. not affected by clean-up
no effective connection between water quality and river usage

clean beautiful river adds property values, leads to increased tourism and revenue

questionable assumptions:
- survey provides a reliable basis for budget planning
- river's pollution and odor only reasons for limited recreational use
- effort clean water and remove odor will succeed 
- cleaning river increase recreational usage
- state plans to clean to river will actually be realized (can imagine misuse of funds 
in renovating riverside facilities only to watch new buildings fall into
dilapidation (破旧不堪, process of falling into decay or disrepair) while state drags river clean-up)
- city can afford to spend more on recreation
- existing facilities along river need more funding, making more money for themselves
