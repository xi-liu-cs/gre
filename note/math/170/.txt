24 = (2 ^ 3)(3)
108 = (2 ^ 2)(3 ^ 3)
lcm(24, 108) = (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
n ^ 2 is multiple of (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
n ^ 2 = i * (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
exponent need to be even to have a integer square root
n ^ 2 = (2 ^ 4)(3 ^ 4)
n = (2 ^ 2)(3 ^ 2) = 36
S = {36i : i in Z} = {36, 72, ...}
36 % 72 = 36, 72 is not a divisor 36, not divisor of every int
