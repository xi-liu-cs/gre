lcm(24, 108) = (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
n ^ 2 is multiple of (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
n ^ 2 = i * (2 ^ 3)(3 ^ 3)
exponent need to be even to have a integer square root
n ^ 2 = (2 ^ 4)(3 ^ 4)
n = (2 ^ 2)(3 ^ 2) = 36

36 % 72 = 36, 72 is not a divisor 36, not divisor of every int

(1 - x) / (x - 1) = 1 / x
x(1 - x) = x - 1
x - x ^ 2 - x + 1 = 0
- x ^ 2 + 1 = 0
x ^ 2 - 1 = 0
(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0
x = +-1
since (1 - x) / (x - 1) has x - 1 in denominator
x != 1
so x = -1 < -1 / 2

mean not robust, affected by extrema
skew right, mean is dragged to right, greater than median
for a right skewed distribution, mean is greater than the median
